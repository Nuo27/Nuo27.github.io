# **About Me**


---

Hi I am **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave:,<br>
I am a recent Graduate from UTS studying Game Development as a major and Data Analytics as a minor. I mainly use C#, C++ in Unity and Unreal Engine. Python for analysing data. Java, Swift for Application Development, and SQL for Database Management. I've done a few original games, which can be found below, and some classic game recreations. I've also completed several applications, plugins, and element systems from school projects.
