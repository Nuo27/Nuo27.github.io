The “Ascension to Immortal” was an indie game I worked on after graduation, and it was a 2D round-based multiplayer card game that is LAN-based. It used Mirror as its main network framework. 

Players can collect elements and buy or keep cards to a certain score to win. 


This program took around 3 months to the current progress and I was the only programmer on the team. I was responsible for the whole game system, including the game logic, UI, and network.


However, this game is only in the test version and has not been released yet. (probably never will be) considering various reasons - 2023.9.12
