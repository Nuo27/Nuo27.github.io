The “Ascension to Immortal” was an indie game I worked on after graduation, and it was a 2D round-based multiplayer card game that is LAN-based. Players can collect elements and cards to a certain score to win. I was the lead prog.

This game is only in test version and not released yet. (probably never will be) - 2023.9.12
