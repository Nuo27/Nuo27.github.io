“Wistful” is a 3D exploration puzzle game featuring the suffocating voids of space, and the hopeless struggle to find salvation.

It's a low poly 3D game with a sci-fi theme. The player will play as a kid astronaut and explore the world to find the way to escape. The player will need to solve puzzles to get throught different levels.

This project was developed in the UTS Subject ‘Game Design Studio 1’ with Unity and I collaborated with other 5 group members. This game was promoted to present in the 2022 School Tech Festival Presentation.
