Shatter was a game project for the Game Design Studio 2 in 2022. We first used UE5 as the development platform and created a multiplayer shoot game via Epic Game service and collaborated with Music students using FMOD. I was the programmer on the team. 

Shatter is a high-octane, 1v1, movement shooter with a de-emphasis on shooting. You have a coin in one hand, and a revolver in the other. Toss the coin up and shoot it. You have 4 different abilities to hot-swap at any time. Shoot at your enemy to increase their knockback multiplier, making them easier to knock off the map. The first player to 5 points wins.
