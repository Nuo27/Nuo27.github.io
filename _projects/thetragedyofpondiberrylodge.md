It’s a 3D exploration detective game, players are invited to find our secret in this house and escape.

This project was the final assignment for UTS Subject “Game Design” and was developed with Unity.I was the team leader and lead Prog in the team. 

There are 1 tutorial level and 4 main levels in this game and each level has its own theme and gameplay. Each member of the team was responsible for one level and I was responsible for the tutorial level and the first level. And as the only programmer in the team, I was also responsible for the whole game system, including the game logic, UI, and network except for the other 3 levels designed by other members
