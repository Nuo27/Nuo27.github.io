“Wistful” is a 3D exploration puzzle game featuring the suffocating voids of space, and the hopeless struggle to find salvation. This project was developed in the UTS Subject 'Game Design Studio 1' with Unity and I collaborated with other 5 group members. This game was promoted to present in the 2022 School Game Jam Presentation.
