Shatter is a high-octane, 1v1, movement shooter with a de-emphasis on shooting. You have a coin in one hand, and a revolver in the other. Toss the coin up and shoot it. You have 4 different abilities to hot-swap at any time. Shoot at your enemy to increase their knockback multiplier, making them easier to knock off the map.
